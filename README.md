MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with Keras:

    1) Importing data set:
       Initially import the dataset using keras.datasets
       
    2) Reshaping the array to 4-dims so that the keras API works
    
    3)Importing the required keras modules and layers and creating a sequential model
    
    4) Initially,keep a layer and after performing convolution operation ,Max Pooling,Flattening.Fix some number of epochs and then run the        algorithm.
    '
    5) More accuracy is achieved by adding hidden layers and also assigning more epochs.
    
    6)Accuracy achieved is 99.4%
